# Apple's Digital Attic aka iCloud

Storage has always been a big issue in my life. After so many software updates I'm left with barely any storage on my mobile device or my mac.
My last resort for a stress free life has been; [iCloud](https://www.apple.com/icloud/). iCloud was supposed to be gateway to a cloud-driven symphony. My primary goal was to synchronize data effortlessly between my iPhone, iPad, and MacBook. <br>

iCloud's interface is similar to what we expect on any Apple website. It starts by asking the user if they wanna upgrade their plan and provides them options.
