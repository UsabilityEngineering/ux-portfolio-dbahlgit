# Apple's Digital Attic aka iCloud
## Dhruv Bahl <br> October 12th, 2023

Storage has always been a big issue in my life. After so many software updates I'm left with barely any storage on my mobile device or my mac.My last resort for a stress free life has been [iCloud](https://www.apple.com/icloud/). iCloud was supposed to be gateway to a cloud-driven symphony. My primary goal was to synchronize data effortlessly between my iPhone, iPad, and MacBook. <br>

iCloud's interface is similar to what we expect on any Apple website. It starts by asking the user if they wanna upgrade their plan and provides them options. The interface was intuitive making it **_Learnable_** and the categorization made it easy to understand where my storage was primarily allocated and guiding me step by step on how to declutter data for better optimization without providing me technical knowledge.

<br> icloud provided me a clean aesthetic which followed Nielson's **Aesthetic and minimalist design approach** of containing information that was relevent and needed with button being orchestrated in a certain fashion that I was able to **_mind map_** where storage and data recovery functionality is located. Although, I would like to argue that icloud's UI/UX is focused on apple users. I could see terms like Handoff which basically means seamless communication between user's various apple products that might confuse other focus group. <br>

In terms of **_efficiency_** I was able to move my data from various products with easy navigation,less action choices and less keyboard strokes. It provided me easy walkthrough of data synchronization from iCloud to my local machine which provided me a great user experience  <br>

The error messages while performing tasks were pretty vague by not giving me enough information about the failure and how to fix it. Another thing that I would like to mention is the inadequate **_error tolerance_** that happens after the storage is full. The automatic response doesn't provide me enough information on how I can delete the cache rather gives me the option of buying a better plan. This weakness can be tackled by providing users more information with less actions on how to get rid of cache, unnecessary files and least used documents rather than pointing me towards upgrading the plan.
